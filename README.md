# Python Coding Course

Greetings!

I'm currently undertaking a coding course, delving into the intricacies of Python. 

This learning adventure is a hands-on exploration, where I apply Python to diverse real-world scenarios, strengthening my coding skills and deepening my comprehension of the language. While managing a full-time role as a Junior DevOps Engineer, I dedicate my spare time to crafting different Python applications.
