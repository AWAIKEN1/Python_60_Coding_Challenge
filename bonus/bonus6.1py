#learning about creating files from a list

contents = ["All carrots must be sliced longitudinally.",
            " The carrots were reportedly sliced.",
            "The slicing process was well presented"]

filenames = ["doc.txt", "report.txt", "presentation.txt"]

# how do we create multiple files - means we need a for loop

for content, filename in zip(contents, filenames):
    file = open(f"../files/{filename}", 'w')
    file.write(content)
